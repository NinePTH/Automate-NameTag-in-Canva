# Automate-NameTag-in-Canva
Using Python language, pyautogui, and pyperclip.<br />
You can make it better with openCV to get better accuracy for better automation.<br />
You can also adapt this with an Excel file along with the pandas library.<br />
# How to use
I'm trying to make it simple for everyone.<br />
You have to use ```print(pyautogui.position())``` to find the position you want to automate then prepare words that you want to use. After that you just have to run ```automate()``` function have open the Canva page.<br />
